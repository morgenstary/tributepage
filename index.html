            Widely recognized as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 20th century, Jimi Hendrix
            pioneered the explosive possibilities of the electric guitar. Hendrix’s innovative style of combining fuzz,
            feedback and controlled distortion created a new musical form. Because he was unable to read or write
            music, it is nothing short of remarkable that Jimi Hendrix’s meteoric rise in the music took place in just
            four short years. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from George
            Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.

            Jimi Hendrix, born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942, at Seattle’s King County
            Hospital, was later renamed James Marshall by his father, James “Al” Hendrix. Young Jimmy (as he was
            referred to at the time) took an interest in music, drawing influence from virtually every major artist at
            the time, including B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Buddy Holly, and Robert Johnson. Entirely
            self-taught, Jimmy’s inability to read music made him concentrate even harder on the music he heard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Al took notice of Jimmy’s interest in the guitar, recalling, “I used to have Jimmy clean up the bedroom all
            the time while I was gone, and when I would come home I would find a lot of broom straws around the foot of
            the bed. I’d say to him, `Well didn’t you sweep up the floor?’ and he’d say, `Oh yeah,’ he did. But I’d
            find out later that he used to be sitting at the end of the bed there and strumming the broom like he was
            playing a guitar.” Al found an old one-string ukulele, which he gave to Jimmy to play a huge improvement
            over the broom.
            By the summer of 1958, Al had purchased Jimmy a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic guitar from one of his
            friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy joined his first band, The Velvetones. After a three-month stint with
            the group, Jimmy left to pursue his own interests. The following summer, Al purchased Jimmy his first
            electric guitar, a Supro Ozark 1560S; Jimi used it when he joined The Rocking Kings.
        </p>

            In 1961, Jimmy left home to enlist in the United States Army and in November 1962 earned the right to wear
            the “Screaming Eagles” patch for the paratroop division. While stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy
            formed The King Casuals with bassist Billy Cox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during
            a parachute jump, Jimmy began working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. By the end of
            1965, Jimmy had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, the Isley
            Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimmy parted ways with Little Richard to form his own band, Jimmy James and
            the Blue Flames, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for the spotlight of lead guitar.

            Throughout the latter half of 1965, and into the first part of 1966, Jimmy played the rounds of smaller
            venues throughout Greenwich Village, catching up with Animals’ bassist Chas Chandler during a July
            performance at Cafe Wha? Chandler was impressed with Jimmy’s performance and returned again in September
            1966 to sign Hendrix to an agreement that would have him move to London to form a new band.
        </p>
        <p>
            Switching gears from bass player to manager, Chandler’s first task was to change Hendrix’s name to “Jimi.”
            Featuring drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, the newly formed Jimi Hendrix Experience quickly
            became the talk of London in the fall of 1966.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Experience’s first single, “Hey Joe,” spent ten weeks on the UK charts, topping out at spot No. 6 in
            early 1967. The debut single was quickly followed by the release of a full-length album Are You
            Experienced, a psychedelic musical compilation featuring anthems of a generation. Are You Experienced has
            remained one of the most popular rock albums of all time, featuring tracks like “Purple Haze,” “The Wind
            Cries Mary,” “Foxey Lady,” “Fire,” and “Are You Experienced?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Hendrix experienced overwhelming success in Britain, it wasn’t until he returned to America in
            June 1967 that he ignited the crowd at the Monterey International Pop Festival with his incendiary
            performance of “Wild Thing.” Literally overnight, The Jimi Hendrix Experience became one of most popular
            and highest grossing touring acts in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hendrix followed Are You Experienced with Axis: Bold As Love. By 1968, Hendrix had taken greater control
            over the direction of his music; he spent considerable time working the consoles in the studio, with each
            turn of a knob or flick of the switch bringing clarity to his vision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back in America, Jimi Hendrix built his own recording studio, Electric Lady Studios in New York City. The
            name of this project became the basis for his most demanding musical release, a two LP collection, Electric
            Ladyland. Throughout 1968, the demands of touring and studio work took its toll on the group and in 1969
            the Experience disbanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            The summer of 1969 brought emotional and musical growth to Jimi Hendrix. In playing the Woodstock Music &
            Art Fair in August 1969, Jimi joined forces with an eclectic ensemble called Gypsy Sun & Rainbows featuring
            Jimi Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Juma Sultan, and Jerry Velez. The Woodstock performance was
            highlighted by the renegade version of “Star Spangled Banner,” which brought the mud-soaked audience to a
            frenzy.
            Nineteen sixty-nine also brought about a new and defining collaboration featuring Jimi Hendrix on guitar,
            bassist Billy Cox and Electric Flag drummer Buddy Miles. Performing as the Band of Gypsys, this trio
            launched a series of four New Year’s performances on December 31, 1969 and January 1, 1970. Highlights from
            these performances were compiled and later released on the quintessential Band of Gypsys album in mid-1970
            and the expanded Hendrix: Live At The Fillmore East in 1999.
        </p>

            As 1970 progressed, Jimi brought back drummer Mitch Mitchell to the group and together with Billy Cox on
            bass, this new trio once again formed The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the studio, the group recorded
            several tracks for another two LP set, tentatively titled First Rays Of The New Rising Sun. Unfortunately,
            Hendrix was unable to see this musical vision through to completion due to his hectic worldwide touring
            schedules, then tragic death on September 18, 1970. Fortunately, the recordings Hendrix slated for release
            on the album were finally issued through the support of his family and original studio engineer Eddie
            Kramer on the 1997 release First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.

            From demo recordings to finished masters, Jimi Hendrix generated an amazing collection of songs over the
            course of his short career. The music of Jimi Hendrix embraced the influences of blues, ballads, rock, R&B,
            and jazz a collection of styles that continue to make Hendrix one of the most popular figures in the
            history of rock music.
